The versatility of cone crushers is impressive, as they can crush various materials with different hardness levels.</p><p>Hammer crushers are mainly used for the crushing of coal, limestone, granite, cobblestone, shale, and other materials that are moderately hard and do not require high crushing ratios. This type of crusher is usually used for soft and non-abrasive materials.</p><p>Roll crushers are another compression-type crusher that is commonly used in the mining industry. They have a relatively low reduction ratio and are excellent for reducing the size of medium-hard and soft materials, such as fertilizers, coal, gypsum, and gold ore.</p><p>In conclusion, the type of crusher you choose for your gold ore processing project depends on the characteristics of your ore, the investment budget, and the amount of time you have.
